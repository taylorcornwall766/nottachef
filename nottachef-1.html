        <h2 class="header2-header">ABOUT US / WHO WE ARE</h2>
        <p class="header2-p">We are a group of people who enjoy cooking, suck at it,
            and love to eat. For 19 years we have been eating over 5 times a day,
            not out of necessity, but out of desire. We will never stop eating, no
            matter how full we get. We love desert, have one with every meal. Eggs?
            Cake would go nicely after.
        </p>

    <div class="header2-container" id="header2-2">
        <h2 class="header2-header">OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p class="header2-p">Our goal is to share that passion of eating and
            cooking to the everyday joe. We do that by sharing recipes that are
            both simple and cost effective. No one should be left high and dry,
            ESPECIALLY those living in food deserts who are restricted to shopping
            at places like dollar general for the majority of their food products.
        </p>

    <div class="header2-container" id="header2-3">
        <h2 class="header2-header">OUR PARTNERS</h2>
        <p class="header2-p">We have teamed up with absolutely no one to make this
            happen. We work alone, like John Wick or James Bond, carrying out
            our mission in stealth. We are so stealthy most people have never even
            heard of us, or our mission. Challenges like that wont stop us, head over
            to our registration page to have your data sold and become part of our elite
            team.
